# UVA Solar Car Team Electrical Team - Embedded System Subgroup
The embedded system sub-group focuses on developing the embedded system for the solar car that controls the CAN bus, driver interface and BPS (Battery Management System). 

## Rule of Contributing to this repo ##
Sub-groups should branch from the master branch and work on developing the code in their own branches. The developing code should be on their own local working files. Repository in each branch should ONLY contain the latest WORKABLE software. DO NOT PUSH THE FILE UNLESS IT IS WORKING. 

Sub-groups can MERGE their branch with the master after the whole group review the code during the group meeting and agrees to merge two branches.
